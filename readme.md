# Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Welcome to this beginner-friendly introduction to **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** the field that helps computers understand and work with human language.

This repository is designed for learning, not research.  
It’s simple, practical, and includes just enough math to help you understand what happens behind the scenes.



## Topics Covered

1. Introduction to NLP — how machines interpret language  
2. Text Cleaning — punctuation removal, lowercasing, normalization  
3. Tokenization — breaking text into smaller units  
4. Stopwords Removal — filtering out common filler words  
5. Vectorization — turning words into numbers with formulas and examples  
6. Word Embeddings — exploring meaning with Word2Vec and GloVe  
7. Visualization — seeing word patterns and relationships  

Each topic builds on the last, moving from text basics to deeper representations.




## Tools You’ll Use

All examples run in **Python notebooks**, using accessible and widely used libraries:

- **Python** — your main programming language  
- **NLTK** — for tokenization, stopwords, and text cleaning  
- **SpaCy** — for tagging and lemmatization  
- **gensim** — for Word2Vec and GloVe embeddings  
- **Matplotlib / WordCloud** — for simple visualizations  

Each tool is easy to use and ready to explore interactively.


## How to Get Started

1. Open `nlp_guide_notebook.ipynb`.  
2. Run each cell step by step.  
3. Read the explanations, follow the math examples, and test the outputs.  
4. Try modifying the code or data to see how results change.  

This notebook is interactive so you can experiment freely and learn by doing.



## Final Note

This repository is a **learning guide**, not a reference manual.  
It combines plain language, light math, and visual examples to help you truly understand how machines process text.
